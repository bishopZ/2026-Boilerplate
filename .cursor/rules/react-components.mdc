# React Component Rules

- Use arrow functions for all components. Never use the `class` keyword.
- Use Chakra UI components (`Box`, `Flex`, `Container`, `Button`, etc.) for layout and styling.
- Use React Router's `Link` or `RouterLink` for client-side navigation.
- Pages must include `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` using React 19 document metadata.
- Every page component must render a Header (PublicHeader or PrivateHeader) and Footer.
- Use lazy loading (`React.lazy`) for page components in `App.tsx`.
- Prefer `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from `react-redux` for Redux state access.
- Avoid nested ternary operators. Use early returns or helper variables instead.
- Don't duplicate code. Extract shared logic into hooks (`src/client/hooks/`) or UI components (`src/client/components/ui/`).
